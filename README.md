## Rehoboam 
### Description
As loud as it sounds, Rehoboam **will completely change the way you use your computer**. It will perform any action on the computer by text request.

Rehoboam will use [AIOS](https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS), abstraction layer over the system kernel to create agents with the ability to use various tools. The main model used in Rehoboam will be Deepseek-R1, but other models will also be supported.
### Planned functions
The order may change
- [ ] First version with basic features.  
- [ ] Creation of Rehoboam website and detailed documentation  
- [ ] Adding HTML fizualization feature  
- [ ] Adding image generation functionality  
- [ ] Adding comunication of different AI's with each other  
- [ ] User-friendly interface for creating tools  
- [ ] Long-term memory using vector database  
- [ ] Creation of tools without code  
- [ ] Ability for AI to create tools itself and prompt the user to add them
